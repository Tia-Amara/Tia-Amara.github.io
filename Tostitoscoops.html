		<h1> Homemade tacos on Tostitos scoops</h1>
		<p>in second place we have homemade tacos on tosito scoops. These are aaing becasuse they are everything that I regular hardshell taco is but in bite sized form! Although they are amazingly delicious nothing can compare to the OG taco. For that reason I rate these a 9.4/10.</p>
